# Plot-Temperature-Vs-Distance-curve-and-Thickness-Vs-time-in-mold-and-solid-at-different-time.

Initial condition:
(a) liquid is at melting temp and is solidified in semi-infinite mold.
(b) no solid is formed at the beginning
(c) there is no interface resistance at mold-solid or solid-liquid
(d) temperature drop takes place in both mold and solid.

Boundary condition:
(a) temperature of liquid remains at melting point
(b) semi-infinite mold

The program should calculate
(a) temperature profile in mold and solid
(b) change in solid thickness with increasing time
using differential form of the equation (not the analytical solution)
